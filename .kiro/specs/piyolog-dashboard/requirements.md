# Requirements Document

## Project Description (Input)
ぴよログから出力できるデータを取込んでデータ分析しダッシュボードで閲覧できるwebアプリケーション。技術スタックはcloudflare-workers,hono.js,typescript,tailwindcss,バージョンはいずれも最新。SPA。

## Introduction
The Piyolog Dashboard is a single-page web application that enables users to import, analyze, and visualize data exported from Piyolog (a baby activity tracking app). Built on Cloudflare Workers with Hono.js framework, this application provides an interactive dashboard experience for understanding baby care patterns and trends through data analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Import
**Objective:** As a parent, I want to import Piyolog exported data into the dashboard, so that I can analyze my baby's activity patterns

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user accesses the data import interface THEN the Dashboard SHALL display available import methods (file upload, direct input)
2. WHEN a user uploads a Piyolog export file THEN the Dashboard SHALL validate the file format before processing
3. IF the uploaded file format is invalid THEN the Dashboard SHALL display an error message explaining the expected format
4. WHEN a valid file is uploaded THEN the Dashboard SHALL parse the data and extract all relevant fields (timestamps, activity types, measurements)
5. IF data parsing encounters errors THEN the Dashboard SHALL report which records failed and allow partial import of valid records
6. WHEN data import completes successfully THEN the Dashboard SHALL display a confirmation with the number of imported records

### Requirement 2: Data Analysis
**Objective:** As a parent, I want to analyze imported data with statistical calculations, so that I can understand trends and patterns in my baby's activities

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN data is successfully imported THEN the Dashboard SHALL compute basic statistics (frequency, duration, averages) for each activity type
2. IF sufficient historical data exists (minimum 7 days) THEN the Dashboard SHALL calculate trend analysis (increasing/decreasing patterns)
3. WHEN a user selects a specific time range THEN the Dashboard SHALL recalculate statistics for the selected period
4. WHERE multiple activity types are present THE Dashboard SHALL compute correlations between activities (e.g., feeding and sleeping patterns)
5. IF data contains time-series measurements THEN the Dashboard SHALL identify outliers and notable events

### Requirement 3: Dashboard Visualization
**Objective:** As a parent, I want to view analyzed data through interactive visualizations, so that I can quickly understand my baby's patterns and trends

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the dashboard loads with imported data THEN the Dashboard SHALL display a summary overview with key metrics
2. WHERE time-series data exists THE Dashboard SHALL render interactive charts (line charts for trends, bar charts for frequency)
3. WHEN a user hovers over chart elements THEN the Dashboard SHALL display detailed information tooltips
4. IF multiple data categories are available THEN the Dashboard SHALL provide filtering controls to focus on specific activity types
5. WHEN a user selects a date range control THEN the Dashboard SHALL update all visualizations to reflect the selected period
6. WHILE viewing the dashboard THE Dashboard SHALL maintain responsive layout across desktop and mobile devices

### Requirement 4: Data Persistence
**Objective:** As a parent, I want my imported data to persist across sessions, so that I don't need to re-import data every time I visit

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN data is successfully imported THEN the Dashboard SHALL store the data in browser local storage
2. WHEN a user returns to the application THEN the Dashboard SHALL automatically load previously imported data
3. IF stored data exists THEN the Dashboard SHALL provide an option to clear or replace the existing data
4. WHERE local storage quota is insufficient THE Dashboard SHALL notify the user and suggest data management options
5. WHEN a user explicitly logs out or clears data THEN the Dashboard SHALL remove all stored data from local storage

### Requirement 5: User Interface Navigation
**Objective:** As a parent, I want intuitive navigation between different dashboard sections, so that I can efficiently access the information I need

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the application loads THEN the Dashboard SHALL display a main navigation menu with clearly labeled sections
2. IF no data is imported THEN the Dashboard SHALL display an onboarding screen guiding users to the import function
3. WHEN a user navigates between sections THEN the Dashboard SHALL maintain the current state (filters, selections) where appropriate
4. WHERE the application detects a mobile device THE Dashboard SHALL provide a mobile-optimized navigation pattern
5. WHEN a user performs an action (import, filter, etc.) THEN the Dashboard SHALL provide visual feedback confirming the action

### Requirement 6: Performance and Responsiveness
**Objective:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and respond instantly to interactions, so that I have a smooth user experience

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the application initially loads THEN the Dashboard SHALL display the first contentful paint within 1.5 seconds
2. WHEN processing imported data THEN the Dashboard SHALL complete parsing and initial analysis within 3 seconds for up to 10,000 records
3. WHILE data is being processed THE Dashboard SHALL display a progress indicator
4. WHEN a user interacts with visualizations (pan, zoom, filter) THEN the Dashboard SHALL update the display within 300ms
5. IF data processing exceeds expected time THEN the Dashboard SHALL provide option to cancel the operation

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Recovery
**Objective:** As a user, I want clear error messages and recovery options when problems occur, so that I can resolve issues and continue using the application

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN an error occurs during any operation THEN the Dashboard SHALL display a user-friendly error message explaining the issue
2. IF a network request fails THEN the Dashboard SHALL provide a retry option
3. WHEN browser compatibility issues are detected THEN the Dashboard SHALL notify the user about required browser features
4. WHERE data corruption is detected in local storage THE Dashboard SHALL provide options to reset or recover the data
5. IF the application encounters an unexpected error THEN the Dashboard SHALL log error details and provide a way to report the issue
